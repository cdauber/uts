But on the soon-to-be couple’s fifth date, Danny decides that before things get serious, he needs to open up to Dalia about an idiosyncrasy of his: to cope with the death of his mother and other sources of anger in his life, Danny starts forest fires.\n\n\n\nAs Danny and Dalia passionately debate anger management techniques and the ethics of burning down forests in the middle of the restaurant, Danny and their very irritated waitress act out memories from Danny’s path to arson in an attempt to persuade Dalia to give Danny a chance. Or at least refrain from calling the police.","Playwright":"Gabriela Tedesch","Show_Dates":"November 25th-27th","Tickets_Link":"https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/4440141","Last_Show_Date":null,"Photo":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlYAAABXRUJQVlA4IEoAAAAwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJaQAAW+m9StVAAP72Eqqbq4cEBANDHmbMxp8UT1xzLQaXv+r+T/I2FL4Ga78j7gAAAA==","aspectRatio":2.031413612565445,"src":"/static/180b2203ceaf08f37053c3bb96470bbf/1f5c5/BurningMan.webp","srcSet":"/static/180b2203ceaf08f37053c3bb96470bbf/d1f52/BurningMan.webp 100w,\n/static/180b2203ceaf08f37053c3bb96470bbf/61e93/BurningMan.webp 200w,\n/static/180b2203ceaf08f37053c3bb96470bbf/1f5c5/BurningMan.webp 400w,\n/static/180b2203ceaf08f37053c3bb96470bbf/ad85c/BurningMan.webp 600w,\n/static/180b2203ceaf08f37053c3bb96470bbf/695e6/BurningMan.webp 776w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}]}}}},{"node":{"data":{"Director":" Joshua Barajas ","Name":"Anon(ymous)","Description_Blurb":"Anon(ymous) by Naomi Izuka is a modern adaptation of Homer's The Odyssey.
