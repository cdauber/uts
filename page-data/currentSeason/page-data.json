But on the soon-to-be couple’s fifth date, Danny decides that before things get serious, he needs to open up to Dalia about an idiosyncrasy of his: to cope with the death of his mother and other sources of anger in his life, Danny starts forest fires.\n\n\n\nAs Danny and Dalia passionately debate anger management techniques and the ethics of burning down forests in the middle of the restaurant, Danny and their very irritated waitress act out memories from Danny’s path to arson in an attempt to persuade Dalia to give Danny a chance. Or at least refrain from calling the police.","Playwright":"Gabriela Tedesch","Show_Dates":"November 25th-27th","Tickets_Link":"https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/4440141","Last_Show_Date":null,"Photo":null}}},{"node":{"data":{"Director":"David Le","Name":"Vietgone","Description_Blurb":null,"Playwright":"Qui Nguyen","Show_Dates":"January 30th-February 2nd, \nFebruary 6th-9th\nPreview January 28th","Tickets_Link":null,"Last_Show_Date":null,"Photo":null}}},{"node":{"data":{"Director":"Alex Stapleton","Name":"A New Work","Description_Blurb":null,"Playwright":"Taylor Halverson","Show_Dates":"February 3rd-5th","Tickets_Link":null,"Last_Show_Date":null,"Photo":null}}},{"node":{"data":{"Director":"Olivia Hagan","Name":"Alice in Black and White","Description_Blurb":null,"Playwright":"Robin Rice","Show_Dates":"May 21st-24th, 28th-31st\nPreview May 19th","Tickets_Link":null,"Last_Show_Date":null,"Photo":null}}},{"node":{"data":{"Director":"Alicia Crowley","Name":"A New Work","Description_Blurb":null,"Playwright":"Hamdi Abdinur","Show_Dates":"May 25th-27th","Tickets_Link":null,"Last_Show_Date":null,"Photo":null}}},{"node":{"data":{"Director":" Joshua Barajas ","Name":"Anon(ymous)","Description_Blurb":"Anon(ymous) by Naomi Izuka is a modern adaptation of Homer's The Odyssey.
